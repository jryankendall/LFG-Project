## About
- LFG Community is a React-based app meant to help hobbyists connect and do things together, whether it's play video games or just chat. It's half forum, half event organizer, and is focused on very short-term organization, with events and threads deleted after a short time.

## License
- MIT

## How to use this code
- Visit the heroku deployment of the page, linked below, and test out its features. It is extremely buggy and doesn't work quite right on the deployment, but it's there at least! Otherwise, if you want, feel free to clone this repository and edit and test things yourself. Make sure to run `npm install` in the root directory; it should install all dependencies in both the express app and the react app directories.
