## Known Issues/Bugs
- Comment messages aren't REALLY required as the labels say they are.
- Occasionally might fail to print out articles due to API call timing out.
- Could be a little better looking
- Refreshing comments lists not implemented, and will only pull new comments upon retrieving from the database again.
- As much as I built in to prevent duplicate articles, the scraper may occasionally pull and store duplicates.

Comments welcome!
